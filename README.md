## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

## Structure
### Folders
- tests :file_folder: This folder contains actual test scripts. 
- services :file_folder: This folder containse enums,pages and steps. Page functions are functions that return Locators or Promises<> that we solve later. We use those functions in the Steps class. The Steps class literally contains the steps that we will do in the test files to execute a test case (add a book to the cart, open the cart, confirm that the book is in the cart).
- download :file_folder: This folder contains downloaded files for testing purposes.
- test-data :file_folder: This folder contains files with test data.

### Files
- :page_facing_up: .gitignore: This file helps while using git repository
- :page_facing_up: package.json and package-lock.json: Those files helps to track dependencies, create a shortcut for running tests, etc.
- :page_facing_up: playwright.config.ts:  This is the global configuration file for the Playwright
- :page_facing_up: tsconfig.json: This is a config file which helps us avoid some JS syntax errors & use better the TS features.
- :page_facing_up: environments.json: 
- :page_facing_up: selectors.json: This is where we store all selectors.

## Useful Commands
